Meeting 10. Dez 2024

Theory:
    - Start with Federated Learning, which should be the focus of Theory, then see what you need to have from ML and DL
    - Explain Formulas, Variables and Shapes thoroughly and always give in/out values
    - Deep Learning as function f(x, theta) -> R^d, introduce everything properly
    - MLP, Gradients, Backpropagation, Derivatives

Code:
    - Can use normal python code with scripts to reproduce, Notebook is fine thoroughly
    - Personal pref. Notebook, include one as Attachment with everything run and plotted, include markdown explanations
    - Python code with empty functions (only in/out or random vectors) instead of Pseudocode
    - Clean code with proper comments
